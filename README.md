AsyncShell reuse experiments
============================

[AsyncShell reuse experiments](https://github.com/carrascoMDD/asyncshell-reuse-experiments) on ways of reusing AsyncShell, 
an asynchronous shell and components for End2end test of JSON APIs and AngularJS user interfaces..

[AsyncShell](http://github.com/carrascoMDD/asyncshell) is an end-to-end test framework, 
declarative through JSON test specifications, 
fully instrumented for detailed observation, 
and fully asynchronous through callbacks.
AsyncShell includes out of the box components to test HTTP end-points and JSON APIs, as well as dynamic HTML and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) applications, and filesystem content and operations.
AsyncShell is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) program, and delegates into [Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor) to test AngularJS applications, itself built on top of [WebDriverJS](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs).
